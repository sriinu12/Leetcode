# # Explanation:
# Key Points:

# We allocate each row of length i+1 filled with 1s.

# We only update positions 1…i−1 from the previous row.

# Handles all edge cases naturally (e.g. when i<2 the inner loop is skipped).
#     The function generates Pascal's triangle up to the specified number of rows (numRows).    
#     Each row is constructed based on the values of the previous row.
#     The first and last elements of each row are always 1.
#     The inner elements are calculated as the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row.
#     The function returns a list of lists representing the triangle.
#     Time Complexity: O(numRows^2) because we are constructing each row based on the previous one.
#     Space Complexity: O(numRows) for storing the triangle.
#     Edge Cases: Handles numRows = 0 by returning an empty list.
#     The function is efficient for generating Pascal's triangle for reasonable values of numRows.
#     The triangle is built iteratively, ensuring that each row is constructed using the values from the previous row.
#     The use of a list of lists allows for easy access and modification of the triangle structure.
#     The function is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for educational purposes.
#     The algorithm is efficient and works well for generating Pascal's triangle up to a reasonable number of rows.
#     The function is implemented in Python, which is a high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity.
#     The use of type hints (List[List[int]]) enhances code clarity and helps with type checking.
#     The function is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into larger programs or systems.
#     The function is well-structured and follows best practices for code organization and readability.
#     The function is a good example of how to implement a common algorithm in Python, demonstrating the language's capabilities for handling lists and loops.
#     The function is a useful tool for anyone interested in learning about algorithms and data structures, particularly in the context of Pascal's triangle.
